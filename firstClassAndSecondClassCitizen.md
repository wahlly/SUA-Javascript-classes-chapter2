# FIRST CLASS AND SECOND CLASS CITIZEN IN JAVASCRIPT

1. ## FIRST CLASS CITIZEN
In programming languages, when you are able to pass, return and assign a type, that type is considered to be a first class citizen. In **Javascript**, ***Functions*** fall into this category because they can be assigned a variable after being declared.

2. ## SECOND CLASS CITIZEN
when you are unable to pass, return and assign a type, it is considered a second class citizen. ***Functions*** in C programming language fall into this category.
